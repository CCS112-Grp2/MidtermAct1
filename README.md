E-Commerce website

Problem Overview
You are tasked with developing an e-commerce website using React.js. The website should include the
following features:

▪ Product pages

▪ Product information pages

▪ An add to cart functionality

▪ Cart summary

Your implementation should showcase your understanding in working with React components, managing
props and state effectively, and demonstrating knowledge of state management techniques.
Requirements:

A. Product Pages: Implement product pages where users can view details about each product (just
used an array of at least ten products).

B. Product Information Display: Each product page should display relevant information about the
product such as name, description, and price.

C. Add to Cart Functionality: Implement a feature that allows users to add products to their shopping
cart.

D. Cart Summary: Display a summary of the items added to the cart, including the total price.

E. Component-based Architecture: Organize your codebase into reusable components. Each
component should have a single responsibility and should be reusable across the application.

F. Props and State Management: Utilize props to pass data between components and manage
component state effectively. Ensure that state changes are reflected in the UI in real-time.

Notes: This is a group work and follow the instructions stated below:

1. Create a Git repository for the project on GitHub. Make sure all team members have access to
the repository.
2. Invite all team members as collaborators or members of the repository so they can contribute to
the project.
3. Break down the product into smaller components and assign to each member so that they can
contribute to the project.
